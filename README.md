# English-to-Hinglish-Translation-Using-Transformers

## Overview
This repository contains a simple tool that translates English sentences to Hinglish. Hinglish is a hybrid language that combines Hindi and English, often used in informal communication. This tool allows you to keep specific English words in your sentences while translating the rest to Hinglish.

## Usage of Transformers

Architecture Overview:
Transformers consist of an encoder and a decoder.
The encoder processes input data, while the decoder generates output.
Each of these consists of multiple layers, and each layer contains multiple attention heads.

Attention Mechanism:
The core innovation of transformers is the attention mechanism.
Attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input when making predictions.

Input Encoding:
The input sequence (e.g., a sentence) is first tokenized into subwords or words.
These tokens are then embedded into high-dimensional vectors.
Positional encodings are added to convey the order of tokens.

Attention Layers:
In the encoder, multiple attention layers process the input tokens in parallel.
Each attention layer attends to different parts of the input sequence.

Applications:
Transformers are used in various NLP tasks, including translation, text summarization, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering.

Advantages:
Transformers have outperformed traditional NLP models in many benchmarks.
They can capture long-range dependencies in text.
Pre-trained models enable transfer learning for specific tasks.

Challenges:
Transformers require substantial computational resources.
Large models may have millions or even billions of parameters.
Fine-tuning on specific tasks often requires task-specific datasets.
